    "about": "I still believe Pluto is a planetâ€”because sometimes, redefining the rules leads to better discoveries. As a product developer and designer, I challenge conventions to create solutions that are not only functional but also spark curiosity and connection. I design for the outliers, the dreamers, and the ones who see possibilities where others see limits.",
